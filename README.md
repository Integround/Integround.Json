# Integround.Json

Integround.Json is a Json &#8596; Xml converter library for .Net projects.

It was developed to provide easy conversions between Xml and Json. It's also suitable for situations where the <a href="https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json" target="_blank">Json.Net</a> library turned out to have some limitations:
- Supports all Json value types (number, string, boolean, array, object, null)
- Supports arrays as root elements
