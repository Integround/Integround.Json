# Integround.Json

Integround.Json is a Json <-> Xml converter library for .Net projects.

It was developed to provide easy conversions between Xml and Json. It's also suitable for situations where the [Json.Net](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json) library turned out to have some limitations:
- Supports all Json value types (number, string, boolean, array, object, null)
- Supports arrays as root elements
